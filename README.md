## Usage

### Landing Page
Navigate to the root URL to access the landing page featuring the Digital Sovereignty Readiness Assessment card.

### Selecting a Profile

Before starting the assessment, choose a weighting profile that matches your organization's industry and priorities:

#### Available Profiles

1. **Balanced** (Default)
   - Equal weighting across all domains
   - Ideal for general assessments or organizations starting their digital sovereignty journey

2. **Financial Services**
   - Emphasizes Data Sovereignty (2.0×) and Assurance Sovereignty (2.0×)
   - Tailored for banking, finance, and payment processing organizations
   - Addresses PCI DSS, anti-money laundering, and regulatory audit requirements

3. **Healthcare**
   - Prioritizes Data Sovereignty (2.0×) and Operational Sovereignty (2.0×)
   - Designed for hospitals, clinics, and health data processors
   - Addresses HIPAA, patient data protection, and life-critical system availability

4. **Government & Public Sector**
   - High weighting across Data (2.0×), Assurance (2.0×), and Executive Oversight (2.0×)
   - For government agencies and public sector organizations
   - Addresses NIS2, FedRAMP, and national security requirements

5. **Technology & SaaS**
   - Focuses on Technical Sovereignty (2.0×) and Open Source (2.0×)
   - For software companies, SaaS providers, and tech startups
   - Emphasizes vendor lock-in avoidance and innovation agility

6. **Manufacturing & Industrial**
   - Emphasizes Operational Sovereignty (2.0×) and Managed Services (2.0×)
   - For manufacturing plants and industrial operations
   - Addresses production uptime and OT/IT integration

7. **Telecommunications**
   - Prioritizes Data (2.0×), Operational (2.0×), and Assurance Sovereignty (2.0×)
   - For telecom operators and network service providers
   - Addresses critical infrastructure and NIS2 compliance

8. **Energy & Utilities**
   - Focuses on Operational Sovereignty (2.0×) and Assurance Sovereignty (2.0×)
   - For power generation, distribution, and utility companies
   - Addresses critical infrastructure protection and NERC CIP

9. **Custom**
   - Fully customizable domain weights (1.0× to 2.0× in 0.5 increments)
   - Adjust sliders to match your specific priorities
   - Real-time visualization of weight distribution

#### How Weighting Works

- **Standard (1.0×)**: Normal priority
- **Higher (1.5×)**: Increased importance
- **Critical (2.0×)**: Maximum priority

Domains with higher weights contribute more to your overall maturity score. For example, in the Financial Services profile, a strong Data Sovereignty score has twice the impact of a strong Open Source score.

### Taking an Assessment

1. **Select Profile**: Choose your industry profile or select "Custom" to set your own weights
2. **Review Domain Weights**: Check the visualization to understand which domains are prioritized
3. **Start Assessment**: Click "Start Assessment" button to begin
4. **Answer Questions**: Progress through 7 domains
   - Use Next/Previous buttons to navigate
   - Answer Yes/No or select "Don't Know" for uncertain items
   - Questions are validated before proceeding
   - Progress auto-saves to browser storage
5. **Submit**: Click "Complete Assessment" on the final section
6. **View Results**: Review your maturity level and recommendations
7. **Download Report**: Generate PDF report with profile information for stakeholders
8. **Take New Assessment**: Start fresh assessment anytime

### Understanding Results

#### Weighted Scoring System

The assessment uses a **weighted scoring algorithm** that considers both your answers and the domain weights from your selected profile:

1. **Domain Score**: Calculated for each domain (0-100% based on "Yes" answers)
2. **Weight Application**: Each domain score is multiplied by its weight (1.0× - 2.0×)
3. **Normalization**: Weighted scores are normalized to a 0-21 scale
4. **Maturity Level**: Final score determines your overall maturity level

**Example**: In the Financial Services profile, if you score 67% in Data Sovereignty (weight 2.0×), this contributes more to your overall score than 67% in Open Source (weight 1.0×).

#### Maturity Levels

Based on your **weighted score** (0-21 points), aligned with the **CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration)** framework:

- **Initial (0-4.2 points / 0-20%)**: Ad-hoc and unpredictable
  - Processes are unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive
  - Success depends on individual heroics rather than proven processes
  - Significant dependencies on external providers with minimal sovereignty controls
  - Focus: Establish executive awareness and basic policies

- **Managed (4.21-8.4 points / 21-40%)**: Project-level management
  - Projects are planned and executed in accordance with policy
  - Requirements are managed, but processes may not be repeatable organization-wide
  - Basic controls are in place but not yet standardized
  - Focus: Build repeatable practices and implement foundational controls

- **Defined (8.41-12.6 points / 41-60%)**: Standardized and proactive
  - Processes are well characterized, understood, documented, and standardized
  - Digital sovereignty practices are consistent and repeatable across the organization
  - Clear governance structures and policies are in place
  - Focus: Ensure organization-wide consistency and pursue certifications

- **Quantitatively Managed (12.61-16.8 points / 61-80%)**: Measured and controlled
  - Processes are measured and controlled using quantitative data and statistical techniques
  - Quantitative objectives established for quality and performance
  - Process variations are understood and controlled
  - Focus: Optimize through data-driven decisions and performance metrics

- **Optimizing (16.81-21 points / 81-100%)**: Continuous improvement
  - Focus on continuous improvement through quantitative feedback and innovation
  - Proactive identification and deployment of innovative sovereignty practices
  - Industry-leading posture with thought leadership contributions
  - Focus: Drive innovation and lead industry best practices
